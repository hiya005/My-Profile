# 🌐 [Hiya] — My Web Portfolio

Hi there! 👋  
This is my personal portfolio project, created as part of my web development assignments. It is  built with **semantic HTML5** and **external CSS**, showing both my coding skills and design sense.

## 🚀 About the Project

This project has **two main stages**:  

**Stage 1 — Semantic HTML5:**  
- Used meaningful HTML5 tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, `<table>`, and `<form>`.  
- Smooth navigation links for easy scrolling.  
- Organized sections: hero banner, about me with photo, project showcase, skills table, and a contact form.  
- Accessibility is considered: images have alt text, forms have labels and required fields.  
- No CSS yet — the focus is purely on **structure and clarity**.  
- **Check it here:** [Assignment-1 HTML](./Assignment-1/index.html)

**Stage 2 — Styled with CSS:**  
- Added a separate `style.css` file for all styling — no inline styles.  
- Navigation menu and buttons have custom colors, hover effects, and padding.  
- Skills table has alternating row colors and bold headers.  
- Sections use margins, padding, borders, and subtle shadows for a clean look.  
- “Back to Top” button is fixed for easy navigation.  
- Responsive design ensures the site looks good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.  
- Fonts are chosen for readability, and color theme is consistent using CSS variables.
